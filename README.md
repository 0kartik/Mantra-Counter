Mantra Counter Application

This repository contains a simple Mantra Counter mobile application developed using React Native (Expo). The project was created as part of an internship assignment, focusing on tracking mantra repetitions with a clean and user-friendly interface.

Features
- Increment the counter manually using a button.
- Reset the counter back to zero.
- Set a target number of mantra repetitions (for example, 108).
- Notify the user when the target is reached (using an alert or vibration).
- Persist counter and target data using AsyncStorage, so the data remains available even after the app is closed and reopened.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

Technologies Used
- React Native (Expo)
- JavaScript
- AsyncStorage (for local data persistence)
